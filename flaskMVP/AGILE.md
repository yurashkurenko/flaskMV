# Agile & Scrum 

### The three amigos of Development 
- the concept of the three amigos is an analogy that attempts to connect the perspectives to examine an increment of work before (business) during (development) and after development(testing)
- Business - what problems are we trying to solve 
            business analyst discuss user stories/requirements/acceptance criteria
- Development - How might we build a solution to that problem
            developers discuss the code 
- Testing - verifying that everything works as it should 
            Testers discuss scenarios/test case 


### Agile Personas 

- Agile personas is the step before constructing user stories. Personas offer a great way to capture the users and customers and thier needs.
- they are fictional characters that have a name; relevant characteristics such as a role, activities, behaviours and attitudes and a goal - which is the problem to be addressed or the benefit that should be provided. 

### Information Radiators 
-  Large graph showing representation of project information 
-  Used

### Scrum artefacts 

Product vision ,Sprint goal (end product),Product backlog 

Sprint backlog - a meeting establishing the overview of the project - including the goals of the project 

Definition of done - the definition of done is all the conditions, or acceptance criteria that a software product is expected to meet or must satsify in regards to the customer. 

#### Scrum 

### Definition of scrum 
- a framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while productivity and creatively delivering products to the highest possible value 

### scrum values 
- Courage
- Focus
- Openness 
- Respect 

### The Scrum Team
- Product Owner
- The development team
- Scrum Master
scrum teams are self-organisational and cross-functional, 
a team that is self-organisational decides between its memebers how best to approach tasks rather than being directed by an entity outside of the team.
- the team model in scrum is desgined to optimise flexibility, creativity and productivity .
- scrum teams deliver products iteratively and incrmentally, maximising opportunitiies for feedback. 
- incremental deliveries of "Done" product ensures a potentially useful version of the product is always available

## The Product Owner 
- The product owner is responsible for maximising the value of the product resulting from work of the development team. The product owner is the sole entity that is responsible for the establishing and managing the product backlog 

## The development Team
- the dev team consists of professionals that work towards the delivery of "done" for a particular product
- a "done" increment is required at the sprint review. - only memembers of the dev team can create an increment

## The scrum master 
- the scrum master reinforce scrum and promote scrum values and theories. 
- the scrum master is the principle communicator with stakeholders outside of the scrum team 

###Â Scrum events 
- these are prescribed events to create and ensure regularity and to minimise the meetings that not defined in scrum. 
- all events are time boxed - such that every event has a maximum duration.

## The sprint 
- The heart of scrum is a sprint; a timeboxed evetn that beginnning from two weeks and elapsing until or before a month where a "done" useable or potentially releseable product increment is created. 
- sprints have consistent durations throughout a development effort. 

## Scrum artifacts 

### product backlog 
- an ordered list of everything that is known or needed in the product. 
- the product owner is soley repsonsible for the product back log - which includes modifying or updating the back log with extra elements to be included

### sprint backlog 
- the sprint backlog is a list of items selected for the sprint plus a plan for the delivering the product increment and realising the sprint goal. 
- the sprint backlog is the a forecast by the development team about what functionality will be in the next increment and the work needed to deliver that functionality into a "done" increment

Sprint 

Daily stand up 

Sprint review 

Sprint retrospective 

Sprint review  

Reviews sprint review weekly, looks back at work done with product owner 

Sprint retrospective 

Reviews sprint based on dev team and scrum master in terms of work methods, potential improvements etc.  

### Root cause analysis  

Ask why five times 

Gets to route cause of problem 

Fixes route cause, possibly involving talking to the larger firm
